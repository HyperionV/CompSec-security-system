## 2025-07-12: Fixed Digital Signature Verification (Feature 8)

### Issue Description
The digital signature feature was not working correctly. Files could be signed successfully, but signature verification was failing with `InvalidSignature` errors for all public keys, including the signer's own key.

### Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, we identified several issues:

1. The signature file parsing in `signature_verification.py` was not handling the delimiter correctly:
   - The code was splitting on `b"---SIGNATURE---\n"` but not handling cases where the newline might be absent
   - This caused the signature bytes to include an extra newline at the beginning, which invalidated the signature verification

2. The verification process needed more robust error handling and debugging to diagnose the issues.

### Changes Made

1. Modified `_parse_signature_file` method in `signature_verification.py` to:
   - Check for both newline and non-newline variants of the signature delimiter
   - Properly strip any trailing whitespace from the signature bytes

2. Added enhanced debugging output throughout the verification process to:
   - Show file paths being verified
   - Display signature file parsing details
   - Log signature and file hash information
   - Track verification attempts with different keys

3. Added a new `verify_directly` method to allow direct verification with a specific public key, bypassing the complex key loading process.

### Testing
- Created a test file, signed it, and successfully verified the signature
- Confirmed that the signature verification now works correctly with the signer's own key
- Verified that the debugging output provides useful information for troubleshooting

### Conclusion
The digital signature verification feature (Feature 8) is now working correctly. Users can sign files and verify signatures without errors.
