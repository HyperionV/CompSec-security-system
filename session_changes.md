## Summary of Code Changes (dave-testing vs. main)

This section summarizes the key code modifications made and committed to the `dave-testing` branch compared to the `main` branch.

**Note:** The first 7 core security functionalities are confirmed to be working as expected. Remaining functionalities are currently untested.

### 1. RSA Key Management Debugging
- **Fixes:**
    - Addressed `error loading key status: 0` by reformatting dates in `gui/tabs/key_management_tab.py`.
    - Resolved `KeyError: 0` by ensuring `get_user_keys_by_id` returns a list in `modules/database_sqlite.py`.
    - Fixed "too many values to unpack" in `modules/auth.py` by adding `json.loads()` for encrypted private key parsing.
    - Resolved `AttributeError` by adding `update_key_encrypted_private_key` method to `modules/database.py` and `modules/database_sqlite.py`.
- **Improvements:**
    - Added debug print statements to `decrypt_private_key`, `store_keys_in_database`, and `get_user_keys` in `modules/key_manager.py` for parameter inspection.

### 2. QR Code Functionality Clarification
- **Clarification:** Explained the distinction between MFA setup QR codes and public key QR codes, and highlighted the import method via the "QR Operations" tab.

### 3. File Decryption Issues
- **Fixes:**
    - Corrected `decrypt_file()` argument from `input_file` to `encrypted_file_path` in `gui/tabs/file_operations_tab.py`.
    - Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` for `PasswordDialog` import in `gui/tabs/file_operations_tab.py`.
    - Corrected `InvalidKey` and `InvalidTag` import paths from `cryptography.exceptions` in `modules/file_crypto.py`.
- **Improvements:**
    - Enhanced debug logging for decryption failures in `modules/file_crypto.py` to show specific exception types.
- **Diagnosis:**
    - Identified that the "Decryption failed: `InvalidTag`:" error for session key decryption was due to attempting to decrypt a file encrypted with an *old* public key using a *newly generated* private key (after key renewal).
- **Solution:**
    - Advised re-encrypting the original file with the new public key.

### 4. Git Operations
- Created a new branch `dave-testing`.
- Staged only modified files (excluding untracked files).
- Committed changes with the message "Apply fixes and features discussed during debugging session."
- Pushed the `dave-testing` branch to the remote as `CrazyDave`.
